v2.7 (Unreleased)
-----------------
### Features 🚀
* 🚀 **[NEW]** Added **[KubeScan](https://github.com/controlplaneio/kubesec)**, a security scanning tool for Kubernetes pods, deployments, daemonsets and statefulsets.

### Additions
* Install Kubescan [v2.11.2](https://github.com/controlplaneio/kubesec/releases/tag/v2.11.2)


v2.6
----
### Features 🚀
* 🚀 **[NEW]** Added **[Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm)** is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Use Helm to:

* Lint and Validate your Helm Charts
* Generate manifests from your Helm Chart Templates
* Find and use popular software packaged as Helm Charts to run in Kubernetes
* Share your own applications as Helm Charts
* Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
* Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
* Manage releases of Helm packages

* 🚀 **[NEW]** Added **[Datree](https://github.com/datreeio/datree)** is a CLI tool that helps prevent Kubernetes misconfigurations from reaching production. Datree is a CLI tool to ensure K8s manifests and Helm charts follow best practices as well as your organization’s policies.

The Datree CLI integration provides a policy enforcement solution for Kubernetes to run automatic checks on every code change for rule violations and misconfigurations. When rule violations are found, Datree produces an alert which guides the developer to fix the issue inside the CI process — or even earlier as a pre-commit hook — while explaining the reason behind the rule.

### Additions
* Install Helm [v3.6.0](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.6.0)
* Install Datree [v0.1.431](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/releases/tag/0.1.431)
* Install Datree Helm Plugin

v2.5
----

### Features 🚀

* 🚀  **[NEW]** Added **[Kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform)**, a Kubernetes manifests validation tool.

It is inspired by, contains code from and is designed to stay close to Kubeval, but with the following improvements:

* high performance: will validate & download manifests over multiple routines, caching downloaded files in memory
* configurable list of remote, or local schemas locations, enabling validating Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs) and offline validation capabilities
* uses by default a self-updating fork of the schemas registry maintained by the kubernetes-json-schema project - which guarantees up-to-date schemas for all recent versions of Kubernetes.

* 🚀  **[NEW]** Added **[Kubeaudit](https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit)**, a command line tool and a Go package to audit Kubernetes clusters for various different security concerns.

### Additions
* Install Kubeconform [v0.4.7](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/releases/tag/v0.4.7)
* Install Kubeaudit [v0.14.0](https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit/releases/tag/v0.14.0)
